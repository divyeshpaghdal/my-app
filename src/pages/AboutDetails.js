                        <p>Back in the day, when most commerce was about legacy companies and their well-rounded reputation, shoppers needed less assurance. But now the game has entirely changed. eCommerce is booming. </p>
                        <p>In this scenario, it has become even more relevant to talk about the origins of your company - where, why, who, how. Remember we were talking about trust earlier? A glimpse into your company/brand’s history will create a sense of transparency, making it easier for shoppers to lean in.</p>

                        <h3>The values of the brand/company</h3>

                        <p>Behind how a company or brand functions, what strategies it employs and how it behaves with its customers, is a set of core values.
                        </p>
                        <p>When shoppers land up on your about us page, they are looking to understand what drives your business better. The articulated values help them understand what kind of impact you’re trying to create and how you intend to fulfil your business goals.</p>
                        <p>
                            Here’s how Thousand Fell describes its brand values in simple and clear language. </p>
