                <p>Back in the day, when most commerce was about legacy companies and their well-rounded reputation, shoppers needed less assurance. But now the game has entirely changed. eCommerce is booming. </p>
                <p>In this scenario, it has become even more relevant to talk about the origins of your company - where, why, who, how. Remember we were talking about trust earlier? A glimpse into your company/brandâ€™s history will create a sense of transparency, making it easier for shoppers to lean in.</p>
